# Idea-Space
A space for my very random thoughts

I'm a gamer girl from the rainy pacific northwest of the United States. I enjoy playing a wide variety of games from sandbox to story-rich visual novels. From classics to the latest releases. So you never really know what I'm going to be doing next. I'm the first to admit that I'm not all that great at a lot of games but we can enjoy falling and dying together.
I'm starting to play around with some coding so that I can make mods for Vintage Story (https://www.vintagestory.at). It's very new to me so I have a huge learning curve. Maybe I'll try my hands on some tutorial videos once I know enough.
